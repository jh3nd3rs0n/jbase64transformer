## Requirements

For building:

-   Apache Maven&#8482; 3.3.9 or higher
-   Java&#8482; SDK 1.8 or higher

For running JBase64Transformer

-   Java&#8482; Runtime Environment 1.8 or higher

## Building

To build and package JBase64Transformer as an executable jar file, run the following commands:

```bash

    cd jbase64transformer
    mvn package

```

## Running JBase64Transformer 

To run JBase64Transformer, you can run the following command:

```bash

    java -jar target/jbase64transformer-${VERSION}.jar [OPTION]... [FILE]

```

Be sure to remove or replace the following:

-   Replace `${VERSION}` with the actual version shown within the name of the executable jar file.
-   Remove `[OPTION]...` or replace `[OPTION]...` with one or more of the command line options described in the usage below.
-   Remove `[FILE]` or replace `[FILE]` with the file you would like to be transformed to standard output. (Removing `[FILE]` will cause JBase64Transformer to use standard input as input instead of a file.)

## Usage
